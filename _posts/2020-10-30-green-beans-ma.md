# Reminds me of Ma

In the kitchen, I had a little square table where me and Samia would chop up the beans (removing the topies) and help Ma make chapatis. 


## Ingredients (cups)

- 750g beans
- 7 green chillies 
- Salt 
- Rai (mustard seeds)
- sunflower oil


## Method

1. Boil beans until almost ready (simmer with not too much water, cover and add 2 green chillies)
2. Wash beans with cold water to cool them and so that they stay green when you fry them
3. Warm oil and rai and 5 green chillies. Oil has to go stoom to add rai (if too hot burns and becomes bitter), add beans and salt 
4. Cook until slightly black.

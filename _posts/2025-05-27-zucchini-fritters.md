# Zucchini fritters or le frittelle di zucchine
From [smittenkitchen](https://smittenkitchen.com/2011/08/zucchini-fritters/).

## Ingredienti (metric)

- 1 pound (about 2 medium) zucchini
- 1 teaspoon coarse or Kosher salt, plus extra to taste
- 2 scallions (or 3/4 red onion), split lengthwise and sliced thin
- 1 large egg (or 2 small eggs), lightly beaten
- freshly ground black pepper
- lemon zest
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour (or 3/4 cup chickpea flour)
- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder

**To serve (optional)**
- 1 cup sour cream or plain, full-fat yogurt
- 1 to 2 tablespoon lemon juice
- 1/4 teaspoon lemon zest
- Pinches of salt
- 1 small minced or crushed clove of garlic

## Cooking
Preheat oven to 150 degrees. Have a baking sheet ready.

Trim ends off zucchini and grate them either on the large holes of a box grater or, if you
have one, using the shredding blade of a food processor. The latter is my favorite as I’m
convinced it creates the coarsest and most rope-like strands and frankly, I like my
fritters to look like mops.

In a large bowl, toss zucchini with 1 teaspoon coarse salt and set aside for 10 minutes.
Wring out the zucchini in one of the following ways: pressing it against the holes of a
colander with a wooden spoon to extract the water, squeezing out small handfuls at a time,
or wrapping it up in a clean dishtowel or piece of cheese cloth and wringing away. You’ll
be shocked (I was!) by the amount of liquid you’ll lose, but this is a good thing as it
will save the fritters from sogginess.

Return deflated mass of zucchini shreds to bowl. Taste and if you think it could benefit
from more salt (most rinses down the drain), add a little bit more; we found 1/4 teaspoon
more just right. Stir in scallions, egg, some freshly ground black pepper and lemon zest.
In a tiny dish, stir together flour and baking powder, then stir the mixture into the
zucchini batter.

In a large heavy skillet -- cast iron is dreamy here -- heat 2 tablespoons of oil over
mediumw heat until shimmering. Drop small bunches of the zucchini mixture onto the skillet
only a few at a time so they don’t become crowded and lightly nudge them flatter with the
back of your spatula. Cook the fritters over moderately high heat until the edges underneath
are golden, about 3 to 4 minutes. If you find this happening too quickly, reduce the heat to
medium. Flip the fritters and fry them on the other side until browned underneath again, about
2 to 3 minutes more. Drain briefly on paper towels then transfer to baking sheet and then into
the warm oven until needed. Repeat process, keeping the pan well-oiled, with remaining batter.
I like to make sure that the fritters have at least 10 minutes in the oven to finish setting and
getting extra crisp.

For the topping, if using, stir together the sour cream, lemon juice, zest, salt and garlic and
adjust the flavors to your taste. Dollop on each fritter before serving. These fritters are also
delicious with a poached or fried egg on top, trust me.

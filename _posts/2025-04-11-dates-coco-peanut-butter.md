# Energy Dates

## Ingredients

- medjool dates (8), cut in half, remove stones
- bar of dark chocolate (50g), ideally 70%
- dried coconut flakes
- peanut butter smooth

## The idea

You can use different nut butters - almond, hazelnut, cashew, but also tahini.

In addition to coconut flakes, other toppings could be sesame seeds, cocoa nibs or flakes.

### Prep

- Melt the chocolate
- Cut in half the medjool dates, remove stones
- Fill inner shell of the halved dates with the nut butter
- Cover with the melted chocolate
- Add coconut flakes
- Wait till the chocolate settles before tasting! 

Yum!!
Can be conserved for a couple of weeks in the fridge.

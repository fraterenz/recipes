## Ingredients

- spinach (600 gr?)
- 1 freshly grated tomato
- 2 cloves of finely chopped garlic
- 2 finely chopped onions
- 1-2 tsp tomato concentrated
- crushed ginger
- green chillies (optional)
- 4 cardamom cloves
- cinnamon sticks
- 2 tsp jeera (cumin) powder
- 4 tsp dhana (coriander powder)
- 2 tsp haldi (curcuma) powder
- a bit of red chili powder
- 1 tsp of garam masala.

## Cooking

Fry in some oil or ghee the cardamom cloves and cinnamon sticks.
Add 2 finely chopped onions.
When the onions become golden brown, add 1 fresh grated tomato and stir-fry until oil separates.

Add tomato concentrated, add the finely chopped garlic and some crushed ginger.
Salt, 2 tsp jeera (cumin) powder , 4tsp dhana (coriander powder), haldi curcuma powder, a bit of red chili powder
and, if you like the taste of green chilies, add 1-2 green chilies (make a cut in the chili ) while frying the
masala. Cook until all the oil starts separating from the masala, then add either fresh spinach or frozen spinach
and let it simmer gently by covering with the lid upside down and put a bit if water on the lid, it should cook
like a Bain Marie. Normally we do not need to add water in the spinach, but Add a bit if needed.
At the end you can add 1 tsp of garam masala.

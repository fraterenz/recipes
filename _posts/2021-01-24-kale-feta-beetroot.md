# What to make with kale

Another ArTona invention, instead of a soup or a risotto. 

## Ingredients (metric)

- sweet potatoes
- feta 200g
- beetroot 
- kale 
- garlic
- salt 
- olive oil 

## Method

Thinly slice the sweet potatoes (once peeled) and in a frying pan, heat some oil with a smashed garlic clove. Add the potato slices and cook on medium heat until it is ready. 

Cut the kale into small pieces and boil for approximatively 10 min or until stems are tender. 

Slice the beetroot into thin slices and cut the feta in small cubes. 

Once the kale is ready add it to the frying pan and turn up the heat. Let it cook for 5 min. 

Mix everything together and it is ready to serve!

Pairs very well with toasted bread, pitta bread. You can even slice some fresh onions and make a sandwich!

## The Martini
From the VAULT newsletter.

We're absolutely delighted that our Coastal Dry Vermouth (AKA "Champagne & Oysters") has been featured in Alice Lascelles' brilliant new book, The Martini - not once, but twice!

Coastal is featured in the Dry Vermouth section of the book where its described as "Fresh, mineral, lean - vermouth at its most exhilarating", sitting alongside just five other vermouths in the category from across Europe.

It's also mentioned in a drink by none other than Three Sheets' founders Max & Noel Venning, in their Foraged Martini. We've included the recipe below.

"The fraternal founders of the stylish London bar Three Sheets have a way of making things look effortless - yet there's always so much attention to detail being paid behind the scenes. This hybrid of a Gimlet and a Martini captures that elegant understatement perfectly, marrying English oyster shell vermouth and leafy nettle cordial with a classic London Dry Gin. Stir for a few seconds longer than usual just to temper the sweetness." - Alice Lascelles

The book is brilliant, distilling down an incredible amount of detail and knowledge into one place. It's informative, witty and an absolute joy to read, AND if you like pretty pictures like us, the design, styling and photography is truly stunning.

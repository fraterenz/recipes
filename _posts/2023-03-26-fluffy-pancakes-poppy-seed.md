# Fluffy pancakes with poppy seeds

Reminds me of mama's pancakes sunday morning. 

## Ingredients

- 2 cups of flour (290g, 10 oz)
- 1/4 cup of sugar (60g, 2 oz)
- 60 grams of butter (60g, 2 oz)
- 1 egg
- 4 teaspons of baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon baking powder
- 2 teaspons vanilla essence
- handful of poppy seeds
- 1 3/4 cup milk (440 ml)

## Method

Combine together the flour, sugar , baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large-sized bowl. 

Whisk the milk, slightly cooled melted butter, vanilla and egg. 

Make a well in the centre of the dry mixture and fold in the milk, slightly cooled melted butter, vanilla and egg. 

Mix together until smooth (there may be a couple of lumps but that's okay).

(The batter will be thick and creamy in consistency. If you find the batter too thick -- doesn't pour off the ladle or out of the measuring cup smoothly -- fold a couple tablespoons of extra milk into the batter at a time until reaching desired consistency).

Set the batter aside and allow to rest while heating up your pan or griddle. 

Heat a nonstick pan or griddle over low-medium heat and wipe over with a little butter to lightly grease pan. Pour Â¼ cup of batter onto the pan and spread out gently into a round shape with the back of your ladle or measuring cup.

When the underside is golden and bubbles begin to appear on the surface, flip with a spatula and cook until golden. Repeat with remaining batter.

Serve with maple syrup and fresh fruit

# Banana bread-cake with chocolate chips

We used to get a slice of banana cake at Knockbox coffee house in Clerkenwell, close to Charterhouse, but it's too sweet. Found this recipe online and it turned out really good! 

## Ingredients

- 3 ripe bananas
- 75 g butter, melted
- 1/4-1/2 cup sugar (100 g)
- 1 egg, beaten
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- salt, to taste
- 1 1/2cups all-purpose flour (185 g)
- 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips (85 g)

## Method

Preheat oven to 180ËšC.

In a bowl, add the bananas and mash until smooth. 

Add in the melted butter and stir until well combined.

Add the sugar, egg, vanilla, baking soda, salt, and flour, and stir until the batter is smooth.

Add in the chocolate chips and pour the batter into a greased loaf pan. Top with additional chocolate chips.

Bake for 40 minutes to 50 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean.

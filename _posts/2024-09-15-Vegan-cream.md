# Vegan cream

We made this the night we forgot to buy an avocado for our tacos! Turned out to be great!

## Ingredienti (metric)

- 1 cup raw almonds
- 1 + 1/4 cups water or almond milk

Optional if make it like a chutney
- coriander 
- a bit of green chilli

Or sweet:
- vanilla

## Instructions

**Soak the almonds**: 

It’s best to soak your almonds in water before starting. There are 2 ways to soak:

Soak almonds in cool water for 2 – 3 hours, drain, and rinse (this method is best for digestion)

For a quick method of soaking, let almonds sit in hot water for 5 – 10 minutes, drain, rinse, and continue with the recipe.

**Blend almonds and water**: 

Place almonds and water in the blender cup and blend until creamy (shown below). Place in a covered container and refrigerate until ready to use. You can also use it right away in any recipe calling for vegan cream.

This creamer is just thick enough to cling to the spoon, for a thicker cream use 1 cup water, adding 1 tablespoon more at a time until desired thickness (or thinness).

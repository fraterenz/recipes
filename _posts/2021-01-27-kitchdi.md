# Comforts your stomach and delicious

Made it for the first time in Yverdon.

## Ingredients (metric)
- 1 cup yellow split moong lentils (soaked overnight or for at least 2 hours)
- 1 cup basamati rice ( or 1/2 cup rice 1/2 c quinoa) 
- 8 cups filtered water
- 1 tsp turmeric 
- 2 cup chopped zucchini 
- 1 cup chopped carrots ( or vegetables of choice; green beans, sweet potato, squash)
- 2 cup fresh spinach chopped 
- Â½ cup coconut milk (optional, but divine)

FLAVA FLAVE (VAGHAR)

- 1 1/2 tbsp ghee butter or coconut oil or sunflower oil 
- 1 tsp cumin powder 
- 1 tsp  mustard seeds
- 1/2 tbsp grated or finely diced fresh ginger 
- 10 fresh curry leaves 
- 2 tsp pink himalayan salt 
- 1/2 tbsp corriander powder 

## Method

Ideally cook in a pot over the stove. 

Drain the mung lentils and rice into a sieve and and rinse under running water till the water runs clear

Add the lentil rice mix and water to a deep cooking pot and leave to cook on medium heat with the lid half on for 15-20 minutes

Meanwhile, prepare vegetables by peeling and chopping them up, add into the cooking pot and place lid back on to allow the vegetables, rice & lentils to bond and become friends for another 20-25 minutes..or until mushy and soupy.

In a smaller pan heat the ghee/oil over medium heat, and add the mustard seeds, cook for a few minutes to release aromatics, and until the mustard seeds have popped. Add the curry leaves and ginger,  stir to combine.

Take off the heat and mix in the spices, the optional coconut milk, spinach & corinader powder into the rice/lentil mix and stir to combine for a couple of minutes  

Feel free to add more water if you prefer as soupier texture.

Serve with green chutney, yoghurt, khadi or simply enjoy it by itself!

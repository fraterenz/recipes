# Francesco's New York invention

While I was out picking buttons for his shirt, Francesco got busy cooking!

## Ingredients (metric)

- potatoes 
- leek 
- salt 
- olive oil
- cumin powder qb

## Method

Thinly slice the leeks and potatoes. 

Add oil in a pan, add the leeks and potatoes. Sprinkle with a pinch of salt and cumin powder. 

Let it cook on medium heat for about 30-40min. 

Served with lots of dishes: entrec√¥te, in an omelette!

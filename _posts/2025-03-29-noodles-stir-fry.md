# Stir fry those noodles
My take on the stir fry inspired by many other people.

## Ingredients

- noodles
- sesame oil
- spices: pepper, chilly
- veggies: broccoli, pepper, carrots, spring onion, mushrooms
- garlic, coriander, ginger, sesame seeds
- beef (sirloin today)
- soy sauce, Chinese vinegar, oyster sauce

## The idea

### Prep and cutting
**the meat.**
Cut the steak in slices, marinate the meat with soy sauce, small amount of vinegar, pepper and oyster sauce

**the veggies.**
- [Chinese Julienne](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/A__GH7HF4eQ) the carrots (or just oblique cut): oblique cut first and then shingle them by turning them by 45 deg, like dominos!
- oblique cut the [spring onions](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/-ZAp0PMyjHA)
- cut the broccoli into [6 wedges](https://www.americastestkitchen.com/articles/2181-don-t-forget-broccoli): put the broccoli with the stem up like a tree, and cut it into 6 equal parts
- cut the mushrooms, peppers
- bruise and break the garlic into tiny pieces (remove the inside part)
- oblique cut the ginger
- mince coriander: fold leaves, cut with horizontal cuts, turn minces leaves by 90 deg angle and repeat horizontal cut (only 2 delicate cuts)

### Cooking
**reverse sear the broccoli.**
Taken from [this](https://www.americastestkitchen.com/recipes/12590-skillet-roasted-broccoli).
- put them into skillet by maximizing flat surface, sprinkle evenly with salt and drizzle with water
- cover and cook over high heat, without moving broccoli, until broccoli is bright green, about 4 minutes
- uncover and press gently on broccoli with back of spatula
- cover and cook until undersides of broccoli are deeply browned and stems are crisp-tender, 4 to 6 minutes
- uncover and turn broccoli so second cut side is touching skillet. Move any pieces that were on top so they are flush with skillet surface
- continue to cook, uncovered, pressing gently on broccoli with back of spatula, until second cut side is deeply browned, 3 to 5 minutes longer
- remove them

**all the other veggies.**
- garlic and chilly
- peppers
- spring onions and carrots
- mushrooms
- remove them

**the meat and noodles.**
- cook the meat with the sauce on medium or high heat
- add sesame seeds towards the end
- remove it
- let it rest while cooking the noodles

Once the noodles are ready, combine everything by adding the coriander.

# Inspirée du Liban!

We didn't have any freekeh so we used farro (spelt). 

## Ingredients (metric)

- 200g farro (freekeh)
- salt 
- olive oil 
- fresh mint
- parsley
- walnuts 
- feta
- pomegrante seeds (1 pomegranate)


## Method

Boil the farro for 20-30 min in water with a drop of oil and salt. When it is ready, let it cool down.

Chop the mint and parsley thinly. Cut the feta up into little squares. 

Once cooled down, add the mint, parsley, feta, pomegranate seeds and walnuts to the farro. Drizzle olive oil and voilà!

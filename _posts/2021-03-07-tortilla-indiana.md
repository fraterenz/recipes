# Delicious as a sandwich as well

Made it for the first time in Yverdon. Inspired from Sabina's tortilla and mama's fluffy omelettes! 

## Ingredients (metric)

- 6 eggs
- salt 
- pepper
- olive oil
- 4-5 potatoes 
- 1 tsp tumeric
- 1 green chili thinly sliced
- 2-3 leeks 

## Method

Peel and thinly slice the potatoes. In a pan, heat some olive oil and add the potatoes slices

Wash and cut the leeks. Add them to the frying pan.

Whisk the 6 eggs. Add the tumeric, a pinch of salt, the chili, and some pepper.

Once the potatoes and leeks are cooked, stir in the eggs and make sure the vegetables are covered with the egg mixture. Let it cook on medium heat for 10-15 min. 

To flip the fritatta, use a plate or another frying pan. Flip the frittata onto the plate and slide it back in or flip the frittata onto another frying pan and cook it for another 5-7 min.

Serve it as is or in a sandwich!

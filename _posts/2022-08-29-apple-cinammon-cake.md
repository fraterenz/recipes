# Apple and cinnamon cake



## Ingredients

- 1 large cooking apple
- 150g butter
- 1 + 2/4 cups flour
- 4 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 1 tsp cinnamon
- 1/2 tsp vanilla essence
- 2 eggs
- pinch of salt
- pinch of cardomom
- baking soda

## Method

Line a 23cm cake tin and preheat the oven to 160C/Gas 3.
Peel a large cooking apple and cut it into thick slices.
Melt butter in a pan on a gentle heat.

Then add flour to a bowl followed by the caster sugar, baking powder and cinnamon.
Give all the dry stuff a good mix and make sure there are no clumps.

Beat 2 eggs in another bowl and add the vanilla essence.

Add the eggs and the melted butter to the dry mix and quickly bring it together using a spatula to create a mix which is almost like a batter.

Add ¾ of the mix to the lined cake tin and spread it out. It might seem like there’s not much of the mixture to you, but don’t worry, that’s how it is meant to be.

Then add a layer of apples to the top of the mix, covering the whole lot. Sprinkle apple layer with cinnamon

Add the remaining ¼ of the mix on top of the apples.

Bake 30 min approx 160°C

 The batter-like mix means you almost get a buttery crust to the edges of the cake, with the middle staying warm and crumbly with soft layers of sweet apple.
It is very good still warm from the oven with a dollop of vanilla ice cream, and will keep well for a couple of days in an airtight tin if you don’t eat it all at once.

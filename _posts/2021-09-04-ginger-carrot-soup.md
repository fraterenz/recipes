# Warm for a cold winter

Ricetta inviata da Nasrine dalla Svizzera per rasserenare lo stomaco deboluccio di Francesco a Numana.

## Ingredients (metric)

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 leek , cleaned and sliced
- 1 cup chopped fennel (1 small head)
- 3 cups chopped carrots
- 1 cup chopped butternut squash (or more carrots)
- 2 garlic minced cloves
- 1 tablespoon grated ginger
- 1 tablespoon turmeric powder
- Salt & pepper to taste
- 3 cups vegetable broth
- 1 (14.5 oz) can coconut milk

## Method

Heat the olive oil in a large dutch oven or saucepan. Add the fennel, leeks, carrots, and squash. Saute for 3 - 5 minutes until the veggies start to soften. Add the garlic, ginger, turmeric, salt, and pepper, and saute for a few more minutes.

Add the broth and coconut milk. Bring the mixture to a boil, cover and simmer for 20 minutes.

Once the soup is cooked, add it to a blender and blend until creamy. You could also use an immersion blender. Taste and adjust seasonings to your taste.
